# Default Predictive Classification for US Companies
The goal of the analysis is to predict whether or not a loan should be approved based on a dataset provided by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirbektoktogaraev/should-this-loan-be-approved-or-denied).\
In order to do so the probability of default of a loan is estimated to understand which variables are most likely to influence this process.\
This dataset has been chosen because the SBA is a reliable government organization, founded in 1953, that fosters small business formation and growth, which have considerable social benefits by creating job opportunities and reducing unemployment in the United States of America.\
The project was carried out in collaboration with other Bocconi University students (Giacomo Bugli, Chiara D'Ignazio, Davide Drago, Nunzio Fallico, Mert Tekdemir).
